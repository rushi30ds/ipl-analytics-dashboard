# ipl-analytics-dashboard
IPL Analytics Dashboard is a data-driven web application designed to analyze and visualize Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket statistics using real match and ball-by-ball data. The project provides a RESTful API built with Flask and a lightweight HTML–JavaScript frontend that allows users to explore team and player performance interactively.

The backend processes large CSV datasets using Pandas and NumPy to compute key insights such as team-wise records, head-to-head statistics, batsman performance metrics, and bowler analytics. These computed statistics are exposed through structured API endpoints, enabling clean separation between data processing and presentation layers.

The frontend dashboard communicates with the backend APIs to fetch and display results dynamically, making the application simple, responsive, and easy to extend. This project demonstrates practical implementation of backend development, API design, data analysis, and frontend integration using Python and web technologies.
